## My Process

### Built With

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Responsive design principles (media queries for screens of 375px and 1440px or larger)
- Flexbox for layout structure

### What I Learned

Working on this project helped me reinforce my understanding of:

1. **HTML Structure**: Organizing content with semantic elements like `<header>`, `<ul>`, and `<ol>`.
2. **CSS Media Queries**: Creating responsive designs for both small and large screens.
3. **Typography and Color**: Using CSS to apply color schemes and adjust font properties for readability and aesthetics.

For example, I applied the following CSS for screen sizes 375px and larger:

```css
@media (min-width: 375px) {
  body {
    background-color: hsl(30, 54%, 90%);
    font-family: 'Young serif', sans-serif;
  }
  .container {
    width: 750px;
    border-radius: 30px;
  }
}
```

### Continued Development

In future projects, I aim to:

- Experiment more with CSS animations.
- Integrate JavaScript to add interactivity to pages.
- Explore CSS Grid for more complex layouts.

### Useful Resources

- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/) - Great resource for HTML and CSS documentation.
- [CSS Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/) - Helped me understand responsive design principles better.
- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) - Used to enhance typography.
